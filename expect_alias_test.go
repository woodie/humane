// expect is the lowercase call-site alias recommended in expect's own
// README ("Lowercase call sites") -- a one-line generic pass-through
// declared once per test package, since Go's capitalize-to-export rule
// only applies across the package boundary. Keeps every call site here
// reading lowercase alongside describe/context/it/before instead of
// standing out as the one capitalized word in the block, with zero loss of
// compile-time type inference. Shared by size_test.go and time_test.go.
